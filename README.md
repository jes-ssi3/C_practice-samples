Hello! These sample programs came from our classes and from Chat GPT given problems. There were several testing and debugging to ensure that it would produce desired output, thus it is not entirely me, but also from the internet.

These are files from my local computer but I cannot seem to add it through my terminal (or something). Upload was easier, but I think it will be hard for me to push and commit changes. I'll be working on that.
